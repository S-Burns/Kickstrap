You must be at least somewhat familiar with the command line to be able to use roots. All the possible commands and options are explained clearly on the [man page](http://roots.cx/docs/man.html).\n\n<p align=\"center\"><a><img src=\"https://raw.github.com/slang800/psychic-ninja/master/terminal.png\"/></a></p>\n\nGetting Started\n---------------\n\nAll roots tutorials and resources that are recommended by the core team are listed below:\n\n- [official roots tutorials](http://roots.cx#tutorials) - walkthroughs of roots' major functionality    \n- [official roots documentation](http://roots.cx/docs) - documentation for major roots features and functionality\n\nDocumentation\n-------------\n\nAll documentation can be found on [http://roots.cx](http://roots.cx).    \nIf you are looking for roots docs, see [http://roots.cx/docs](http://roots.cx).    \nIf you are after the docs for the css library, [axis](https://github.com/jenius/axis), see [http://roots.cx/axis](http://roots.cx).\n\nHelp\n----\n\nIf you are confused and/or having trouble, one of the solutions below will almost certainly get you back on your feet:\n\n- Consult [the docs](http://roots.cx/docs)\n- File [an issue](https://github.com/jenius/roots/issues)\n- Ask us in the official IRC channel on freenode, **#roots-dev**\n- [Tweet at me](http://twitter.com/jescalan), and we'll work it out\n\n\nThe Future\n----------\n\nSee the [issues](https://github.com/jenius/roots/issues) for discussion of upcoming features and additions. Roots is very actively developed and is moving forward at a rapid pace. Our goal is to push static sites and \"single page apps\" as far as they can possibly go, and we're well on the way.\n\nContributors\n------------\n\nI would love to have more contributors, and if you've helped out, you are awesome. I want to give a huge thanks especially to these people:\n\n- [Sam Saccone](https://github.com/samccone)\n- [Sean Lang](https://github.com/slang800)\n- [Declan de Wet](https://github.com/declandewet)\n- [Everyone else](https://github.com/jenius/roots/contributors)\n\nWe are very open to new people getting involved and contributing. Come chat with us on IRC at freenode/#roots-dev if this seems like your kind of jam.\n\nCoding Style\n------------\nTo keep a consistant coding style in the project, we're going with [Felix's Node.js Style Guide](http://nodeguide.com/style.html) for JS and [Polar Mobile's guide](https://github.com/polarmobile/coffeescript-style-guide) for CoffeeScript, but it should be noted that much of this project uses under_scores rather than camelCase for naming. Both of these are pretty standard guides. For documenting in the code, we're using [JSDoc](http://usejsdoc.org/).\n\nLicense (MIT)\n-------------\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal in the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
