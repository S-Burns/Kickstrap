			p.lead Made with the best tech on Earth.
			p Kickstrap seamlessly combines Bootstrap with top-tier web technologies. It's so advanced, it can run an authenticated, database-driven web app 
				strong without a native backend.
			p This is accomplished by the coupling of Google's Angular.js and Firebase.io, a websocket Backend as a Service (Baas). This is ready to go out-of-the-box, but optional to use.

			p Kickstrap works with Firebase's cloud-based backend from square one. Via an agreement with Firebase, we're able to set up all of our users with a special, unlimited usage, read-only sample database out-of-the-box. You can then copy this to your own Firebase account and set up your own custom read/write and authentication permissions.

			p.lead Keeping track of and staying up to date on your static resources (JS, CSS, fonts, images...) and their dependencies is painful.
			p Kickstrap's partnership with JSPM.io provides a strong front-end package dependency manager built on Require.js.
			p Kickstrap apps are unit JSPM bundles of static resources that can be run at any time in the web app's lifetime. 
			p JSPM also allows for loading resources from npm, CDNJS, and GitHub via its CDN registry.
