Opening chrome for local development
====================================

open -a /Applications/Google\ Chrome.app --args --disable-web-security

Using your own Firebase
=======================

Simply change the ``firebaseName`` in settings. This, however will create a totally empty Firebase. To populate with the same dummy data, we've supplied an importable JSON file in Kickstrap's js directory.

Creating a theme
================

Create a theme with the default Bootstrap customizer.
http://getbootstrap.com/customize/

To make it as easy as possible to make a theme, we've ensured our themes work perfectly with any made from Bootstrap's own theme creator.
