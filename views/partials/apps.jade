h1 Creating Apps
p.lead Apps are local JavaScript and CSS files that run as asynchronous packages.

p An app will have at least two to three parts:
ol
	li A directory under assets/apps/
	li A main.coffee file
	li Optional css or js resources main.js will run.

h2 Hello World app
p Let's create the most basic of apps. This will display a javascript message that says "Hello World".
ol
	li In apps, create a new directory called "helloworld"
		ul
			li
				span.glyphicon.glyphicon-folder-open &nbsp;
				| helloworld
	li In helloworld/, add a blank file called main.coffee
		ul
			li
				span.glyphicon.glyphicon-folder-open &nbsp;
				| helloworld
				ul
					li
						span.glyphicon.glyphicon-file &nbsp;
						| main.coffee
	li Add the following to main.coffee
		pre alert 'hello world'
	li In settings.coffee, add 
		code 'ks:helloworld'
		|  to your 
		code k$.apps
		|  array.
		pre apps: [
			|   'ks:sample-app'
			|   'ks:tinygrowl'
			|   'ks:ang-app'
			|   'ks:helloworld'
			| ]
	li Now when you refresh your page, you should see the alert. Keep reading for more complex use cases.
h2 Hello world with extra resources
p This app will do the same as our first but will get the alert from another js file and load a css file.
ol
	li Create the app from above
	li Erase main.coffee and add the following
		pre define [
			|  './helloworld'
			|  './helloworld.css!'
			| ], () ->
		p Be sure you have the "!" after the .css
		p We're telling JSPM to look for two resources, helloworld.js and helloworld.css. We don't have to write '.js' but you'll need to specify a css file is being loaded with the extension and an exclamation point.
	li Create a blank helloworld.coffee in /apps/helloworld/ and write the following
		pre alert 'hello world'
	li Create a blank helloworld.styl in /apps/helloworld/ and write the following
		pre body
			|   background-color: orange !important
		p This is a stylus file, which will be converted by roots to a .css file as we watch and compile. The 
			code !important
			|  suffix overrides any other declaration of background-color on the body. This won't be pretty, but it will be a useful test.
	li Refresh the page. You should now see both the "hello world" alert and a yellow page. Keep reading, there's more we can do with apps.
h2 Hello world with dependencies
p Continuing with our hello world app from the previous two examples, this app will need to know jQuery is loaded before it tries to use $ functions.
ol
	li Create the app from above
	li Edit main.coffee so it reads as such:
		pre define [
			|  'jquery'
			|  './helloworld.css!'
			| ], ($) ->
			|   alert 'Hello world. Running jQuery version ' + $.fn.jquery
	li Delete helloworld.coffee. We no longer need this.
	li Refresh. You should now see what we had before, but with the jQuery version in the message. This proves the app is waiting for jQuery to be loaded before executing any script.
