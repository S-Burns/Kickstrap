Compiling
=========

Kickstrap will compile all resources in the ``kickstrap`` directory to a folder structure on the same level. 
By default, this compiled directory is called ``public``

So before compile you should see this:

    .
    ..
    kickstrap/

And after compile, you will see this:

    .
    ..
    kickstrap/
    public/

Adapters
--------

However, depending on the framework you are using with Kickstrap, you may need assets and view to compile into a specific
structure. For this need, there are adapters.

Adapters tell the Kickstrap compiler how to organize compiled assets and views and what folders to create. I've provided a 
Rails adapter by default.

The adapter can be set in ``compile.json``. 

	{
	   // Have your files compile into a directory structure
	   // specific to your framework. Rails included as an example.
	   // See the docs on how to create adapters.
	   compile-adapter: 'default'
	}

Changing ``compile-adapter`` from ``'default'`` to ``'rails'`` would result in the following export structure:

    .
    ..
    kickstrap/
    app/
      assets/
        javascripts/
        stylesheets/
      views/
